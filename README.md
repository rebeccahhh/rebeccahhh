## Hi, I'm Beccah.
You can usually find me around the internet as @rebeccahhh  </br>
I'm a [Berea College](https://www.berea.edu) graduate with a degree in Computer and Information Science and I work at Red Hat on Ansible as a performance and scale engineer. I mostly hang around on the [AWX](https://github.com/ansible/awx) Project. </br>
